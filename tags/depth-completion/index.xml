    <description><![CDATA[Sparsity Agnostic Depth Completion Andrea Conti &middot Matteo Poggi &middot Stefano Mattoccia [Paper] [Code] Overview State-of-the-art Depth Completion approaches yield accurate results only when processing a specific density and distribution of input points, i.e. the one observed during training, narrowing their deployment in real use cases. We present a framework:
 robust to uneven distributions and extremely low densities by structure trained with a fixed pattern and density as competitors, without any need of augmenting  Experimental results on standard indoor and outdoor benchmarks highlight the robustness of our framework, achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods when tested with density and distribution equal to the training one while being much more accurate in the other cases.]]></description>
